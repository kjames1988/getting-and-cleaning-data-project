2. imports the datasets
..*training and the test sets
..*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  3.  merge column to get data frame for all data 
  ..* extract mean or standard deviation
  4.  gets activity and subject data for each dataset and merges those columns with the dataset
   
   5. Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
