###The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1.Download and unzip  the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. imports the datasets
..* training and the test sets
..* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  3.  merge column to get data frame for all data 
  ..* extract mean or standard deviation
  4.  gets activity and subject data for each dataset and merges those columns with the dataset
   5. Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
   6. Created a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean)
